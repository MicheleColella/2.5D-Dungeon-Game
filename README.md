# 2.5D Dungeon Game

Welcome to the official repository for "2.5D Dungeon Game," an ambitious platformer project developed with Unity. This title combines pixel art aesthetics with innovative mechanics and deep playability to offer a unique and engaging experience. Characters and settings are rendered in a pixel art style with a 2.5D perspective, lending the game a distinct visual dimension and a nostalgic atmosphere.

## Key Features:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Aesthetics and Environment:</strong> Pixelated images and detailed 2.5D settings bring to life a rich and immersive game world. 2D characters move fluidly within an environment that, while also pixelated, stands out for its visual depth and complexity blurring between two and three dimensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedural Dungeon Generation:</strong> Each game session is unique due to the procedural generation of dungeons. Rooms, corridors, and challenges constantly change, requiring players to adapt their exploration and combat strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Freedom of Movement and Abilities:</strong> Players can exploit a wide range of movements to navigate the game's spaces, including jumping, sliding, climbing, and wall-jumping. This freedom of movement is essential for overcoming physical obstacles and environmental puzzles that the dungeons present.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Combat System:</strong> Engage enemies with a sword for close combat or strike from afar with a blaster that can shoot various types of projectiles, including normal shots, tracking shots that follow enemies, and powerful area effect blasts.</li>
  <li><strong>Innovative Time Manipulation:</strong> Use three powerful temporal abilities to dominate combat and solve puzzles. Slow down time to act with superhuman reflexes, rewind events to correct mistakes or try different strategies, and completely stop time to plan your next move with surgical precision.</li>
  <li><strong>Intuitive Navigation and UI:</strong> An interactive map not only shows the dungeon structure and the path to the boss but also the location of enemies, updating in real-time. Intuitive UI controls allow easy monitoring of character vital stats and the amount of nearby enemies.</li>
  <li><strong>Reactive Music and Sound:</strong> The music tracks and sound effects are not only high-quality but also reactive to the player's actions, particularly the use of temporal abilities, adding an additional layer of immersion to the game.</li>
</ul>
